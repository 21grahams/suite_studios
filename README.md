The Kanye West API. A simple user friendly application designed for one thing in mind - laughing. Are you like the rest of us and get a kick out of things that come out of Kayne West's mouth? You're in luck! With a simple click of a button, you can browse through dozens upon dozens of tweets sent out by the one and only Yeezy. Already sick to your stomach? No worries! Click another button and the tweets are hidden from sight.
